# Rock_paper_scissors

 ROCK beats SCISSORS, SCISSORS beat PAPER and PAPER beats ROCK
 
 The game lasts 5 rounds. At the beginning of each round, the player must make his choice. After the fifth round, the score and history of the game will be shown.

I wrote this game using XAMPP, thats why you see all links like http://localhost:8080/gruppe18/ue3/.



And now to the game itself:

This is how the home page of the game looks. when you hover over a new game, the button changes color.

Then you get to the game and you need to make your first choice. When you hover over the pictures, then the borders are highlighted.a
 After making a choice, the computer makes its choice and the result will be shown. And so on until the fifth round.

If you want, you can play again and you need to click on the new game button, which changes color on hover. After pressing the button, the result is reset and the counting starts over.
